The basic app component will consist of 3 components. The `<App />` component will be our parent component, followed by the `<SearchBar />` and `<ImageList />`.

The `<SearchBar>` component will handle users input.

The `<ImageList />` component will render html image element based on the request made, and will source the image to an outside server via API requests.
